# 🔐 Encrypted Chat Application

A lightweight, **text-based chat application** built with a focus on **basic-level encryption** to provide fundamental data security.  
This project is designed to demonstrate the real-world implementation of encryption techniques and enhance understanding of **network communication** in software systems.

---

### 📌 Project Purpose

> Developed as part of the *Computer and Network Security* course, this project aims to integrate **theoretical knowledge** with a **hands-on software development** experience.

---

### 💡 Key Highlights

- ✅ Built-in **Caesar Cipher**-based message encryption
- ✅ Simple and clean **text chat interface**
- ✅ Reinforces concepts of **client-server communication**
- ✅ Shows how **encryption** can be integrated into real-time applications
